So here's the equivalent of a 'Hello, World!' exercise for Jekyll.

Following this simple guide [here](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/) from [Smashing Magazine](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/) should get you set up with your own GitHub Pages hosted website running a static site created by Jekyll.

The next steps are to update the site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository as shown below:

![_config.yml]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/config.png)

The easiest way to make your first post is to edit the first one. You can go into '/_posts/' and update the 'Hello World' markdown file. For more instructions head over to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) on GitHub.
