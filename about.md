I'm a Software Engineer with a passion for all things tech.

### 

GitHub Pages & Jekyll power this blog. Jekyll is a static site generator, which has the benefit of not needing any install dependencies nor needing any local development setup; as GitHub does all of that for you. Since I don't have the need for a database or any dynamic content here, Jekyll works out well.
