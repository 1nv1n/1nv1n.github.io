I don't have much to say about myself other than my interests revolve around, but are not limited to, software & technology. 
I've only recently started using & exploring the many options offered by GitHub.
One of their features, GitHub Pages is what powering this website. A repository created & named with a GitHub username results in GitHub creating a static website.

### 

I've used Jekyll to help create a website without having to define a template. Jekyll is a static site generator, which has the benefit of not needing any install dependencies nor needing any local development setup as GitHub does all of that for you. Since I don't have the need for a database or any dynamic content here, Jekyll works out well for my purposes.
