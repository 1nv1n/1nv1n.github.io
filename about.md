GitHub Pages powers this website. All that was needed was a repository to be created & named with a GitHub username and you end up with a static website.

### 

I've used Jekyll to help create this blog since that doesn't require one to define a template. Jekyll is a static site generator, which has the benefit of not needing any install dependencies nor needing any local development setup as GitHub does all of that for you. And since I don't have the need for a database or any dynamic content here, Jekyll works out well.
